# PLD+ (Peer Learning Day Plus)

PLD+ is a collaborative web application developed by Siduduzile Mdima and Franklin Obiukwu to enhance the Peer Learning Day (PLD) experience for students enrolled in the ALX Software Engineering Program. PLD+ facilitates productive peer learning sessions by providing essential features for scheduling meetings, coordinating time zones, and enabling leadership roles within PLD groups.

## Features

- **Schedule PLD Sessions:** Hosts can easily create and schedule PLD sessions, specifying the date, time, topic, and meeting platform link.
  
- **Time Zone Coordination:** PLD+ automatically adjusts meeting times to accommodate participants' time zones, ensuring seamless coordination across different regions.

- **Email Notifications:** Users receive email notifications 30 minutes before the start of each scheduled PLD session, providing timely reminders and session details.

- **Join Meetings Easily:** Participants can join PLD sessions with a single click, accessing the meeting group on the designated platform (e.g., Google Meet, Discord) directly from PLD+.

- **Filter and Search:** Users can filter and search for PLD sessions based on topics or dates, making it convenient to find sessions relevant to their interests or availability.
